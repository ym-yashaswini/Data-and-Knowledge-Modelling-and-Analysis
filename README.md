# ECE 657a - Data & Knowledge Modelling & Analysis
Python(NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, matplotlib, plotly, seaborn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
Analyze and prepare data, describe and apply theoretical concepts in Data Science and Machine Learning, design data processing pipelines and implement important machine learning algorithms on a range of datasets and tasks.

**Assignment 1:** Using two datasets, perform data cleaning and preprocessing, feature extraction and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Data Summarization (Summary statistics, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Histograms). Data Classification using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) 

**Assignment 2:** Using two datasets, perform data preprocessing, splitting, and classification. The classification algorithms that to be used are: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Networks, k Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine (wirh RBF kernel) experimenting with the parameter selection. Produce confusion matrices and compare. Data Normalization (min-max, z-score, mean subtracted) and datapoint distance (Manhattan, euclidean, cosine). Eigenvector Decomposition (PCA)

**Assignment 3:** Set up and train two types of Convolutional Neural Networks (one standard, one your own choice) using a modern python neural network library for classifcation on the FashionMNIST dataset.Classify the data using a Convolutional Neural Network with Two CNN layers with Kernel size of (3,3) and 32 filters, stride of 1 with padding size of (1,1) and max-pooling between these two CNN layer with pool size of (2,2) and at the end one fully that map the last CNN layer to 5 outputs. ReLU activation functions. Softmax output layer for the classication decision
